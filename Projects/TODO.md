# To Do 

Projects in progress
--------------------

* AI/Civilization Limit
  - Consider if getting rid of the 2 stack variables which are created to check the game version and then are destroyed before AIs are lodaded is worthwile
  - Make the AI/Civilzation Limit patch get the AI file names from the AI path specified inside the .exe, since some mods do not use the default \AI3 directory
  
* Revolutionary Banners
