# AoE3 Community UnHardcode Project

Summary
-------

The main purpose of this project is to investigate and research on the hardcoded features of Age of Empires III that pose a limitation to modding.

Some examples of such features, which we are or will be investigating, include:

* 14 AI/civilization limit
* Revolutionary Banners
* Export UI for Asian civs and Fire Pit UI for Native civs
* Trickle of Fame resource
* et al.

Most of the code used for this project is programmed in Assembly.
