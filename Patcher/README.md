# AoE3UnHardcode Patcher

This is a tool that has been developed with the purpose of making it easier for modders to use the codes provided by this project.

How to use
----------

In order to use it, and thus apply the patches provided by this project in your mod's .exe, just download the main executable (UHCPatcher.exe) and all .uhc files in this directory and place them on your AoE3 Folder (usually C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Age of Empires III for CD installations and C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\Age of Empires III\bin for Steam-based installations).

After that, just drag and drop your Age of Empires III TAD executable over the UHCPatcher application. You'll be prompted about which patches you want to apply and the Patcher will backup the .exe automatically.

To Do
-----
* Add the Revolution Banners patch to the Patcher
* Implement a proper GUI
* Make the patcher display more specific error messages
* Allow the Patcher to change the hardcoded filenames of some of the files that are loaded by the executable
* Add commandline options
